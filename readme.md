I've been using PancakeApp for a few years now, and I've found it very useful and it continues to be updated; however, 
there are features that I'd like to see added and I just prefer working with Laravel over CodeIgniter, so I'm rebuilding
Pancakeapp in Laravel - partly as a learning exercise and partly so I can have a bit more freedom with the UI. While 
CodeIgniter has its advantages, I feel that Laravel is much more elegant.
